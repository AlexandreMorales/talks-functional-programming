# About Me
Static
Multithread
Idempotente (static, Multithread, pure function, Static consume less memory and therefore perform better than traditional data structures. isolating them from the rest of the software code)
Expressividade (melhor nomenclatura [filter, map, find, reduce])
Imutabilidade (single responsibility, Avoiding shared states(OOP) ensures that the timing and order of function calls do not impact the results of calculations.)
Variables That Don’t Vary
Functional programming doesn’t use loop constructs such as repeat, for and while. Instead, it relies on recursion for looping.

CURRYING (the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and returning a series of functions that take one argument and eventually resolve to a value.)
CLOSURE (the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.)
HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION (Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.)
PURE FUNCTIONS (Given the same input, will always return the same output and produces no side effects.)
Of course, there’s only so much you can do with pure functions, and functional languages can’t entirely eliminate side effects; they just confine them. Parts of your code have to be impure, but the goal of functional programming is to limit impure code and keep it separate from everything else.
Imperative code makes frequent use of statements like for, if and switch. Declarative code, on the other hand, relies more heavily on expressions


Monads (wrap types giving them additional behavior like the automatic propagation of empty value or simplifying asynchronous code.)
Functor (A Functor is a container which can be mapped upon by a Unary function.)


Why?
When? Lisp, developed in the late 1950s by John McCarthy
